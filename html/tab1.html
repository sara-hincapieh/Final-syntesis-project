<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  The following project contains fundamentals of concepts related to physics, such as renewable and electrical energy and its units of measurement (WATT); In addition, a detailed analysis of the energy consumption of each one of the members of the group is made, supported by graphs that support it.

  <h3><strong>Electrical Energy</strong></h3>

    Electric energy is the energy that results from the movement of charged
    particles, such as electrons, through a conductor. This type of energy is
    often associated with electricity, and it is used to power many devices and
    systems, from small household appliances to large industrial machinery.
    Electric energy can be generated through a variety of methods, including
    burning fossil fuels, harnessing the power of wind or water, or using
    nuclear reactions. It can also be stored in batteries or capacitors for
    later use. When electric energy is converted into another form of energy,
    such as light or heat, it is often referred to as electric power.

  <h3><strong>WATTS</strong></h3>
  <p>

    the International System of Units (SI). It is defined as the amount of
    energy transferred per second or the speed at which work is done. More
    specifically, one watt equals one joule of energy per second. This unit is
    commonly used to express the performance of electrical devices such as light
    bulbs, motors, and electronics. For example, a 100-watt light bulb uses 100
    joules of energy every second it is turned on. The Watt is named after James
    Watt, an 18th-century Scottish inventor and engineer who helped develop the
    steam engine.

  <h3><strong>Scatter Plot</strong></h3>

  <p>
    <img src="../img/3.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px" />A scatterplot is a type of
    graph that shows the relationship between two variables. It consists of a
    series of points, each representing a unique combination of values ​​for the
    two variables being analyzed. One variable is plotted on the horizontal axis
    while the other variable is plotted on the vertical axis. Each point on the
    scatter plot represents a single observation, and the position of the point
    indicates the values ​​for both variables. Scatterplots are commonly used in
    statistical analysis to identify patterns, trends, and correlations between
    variables. By visually examining the distribution of points on the
    scatterplot, it is possible to determine the strength and direction of the
    relationship between the analyzed variables.

  <h3><strong>Linear Regression</strong></h3>
  <p>
    <img src="../img/4.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px" />A scatterplot, also known as
    a scatterplot, is a type of chart that represents data points as a
    collection of points in a two-dimensional coordinate system. Each point on
    the chart represents the values ​​of two variables for a single data point.
    The horizontal axis of the chart represents one variable while the vertical
    axis represents the other variable. </br> </br> Scatterplots are often used to identify
    relationships between variables, e.g. B. Correlation or causation. By
    examining the pattern of points on the chart, you can see if there is a
    trend or a pattern in the data. For example, if the points on the graph
    appear to be grouped around a straight line, this indicates a strong linear
    relationship between the variables.</br> </br>Alternatively, if the points appear
    randomly scattered, this indicates little to no relationship between the
    variables. Scatterplots are commonly used in fields such as statistics, data
    analysis, and scientific research to visualize and interpret complex data
    sets. They are a useful tool for identifying trends and patterns in data and
    making predictions based on monitored relationships between variables.

  <h3><strong>Renewable Energy</strong></h3>

  <p>

    Renewable energy refers to energy that comes from natural resources that are
    replenished over time, such as sunlight, wind, rain, geothermal energy, and
    biomass. Unlike non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels, renewable
    energy sources are sustainable and do not produce harmful emissions or
    contribute to climate change.</br> </br> Renewable energy is becoming an increasingly
    important part of the global energy mix as countries look for ways to reduce
    their dependence on fossil fuels and meet their energy needs in more
    sustainable ways. Common examples of renewable energy technologies are
    photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, hydroelectric power plants and
    geothermal energy systems.</br> </br> Renewable energy has many benefits, including
    reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality and creating new
    economic opportunities. However, there are also challenges in scaling
    renewable energy systems, such as the need for large upfront investments,
    disruption issues, and the need for adequate energy storage solutions.
    Despite these challenges, many experts believe that renewable energy has the
    potential to play an important role in meeting the world's future energy
    needs.
