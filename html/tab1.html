    Electric energy is the energy that results from the movement of charged
    particles, such as electrons, through a conductor. This type of energy is
    often associated with electricity, and it is used to power many devices and
    systems, from small household appliances to large industrial machinery.
    Electric energy can be generated through a variety of methods, including
    burning fossil fuels, harnessing the power of wind or water, or using
    nuclear reactions. It can also be stored in batteries or capacitors for
    later use. When electric energy is converted into another form of energy,
    such as light or heat, it is often referred to as electric power.
