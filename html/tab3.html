<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression: A positive linear relationship is found between the independent variable (x) and the dependent variable (y), because the estimate of the y-axis data increases as the value in x increases, however, taking the formula as starting point of a linear function (y = mx + b) where the slope, which in this case is 7.00, and when m>0 is fulfilled, the straight line rectifies its ascending condition.</li>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors: We must identify two elements presented in the graphic, the first is the scatter diagram, and the regression line, which is the gray dotted line, looks for a relationship between the points of the diagram, because the line is at a shorter distance with respect to to the sum of all of them and that is why although the data for months 1 and 5 do not comply with that pattern of the line with respect to the axis, that relationship continues to exist, because the regression seeks to predict even though it sometimes does not turn out to be very exact.  </li>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that:Making use of the equation y=7.00x + 75.60(it helps us to forecast the change in y by x) and assigning the variable x the value of 6, this number, since this is the next month, gives us as a result of the estimate that in the month of May 117.6 Kwh would be consumed
  </li>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
    remain stable the consumption of electric energy:The fact that the diagram was in continuous rise from December 2022 to March is really a worrying aspect therefore the ideal is to begin to have a decrease, not only for the issue of a  payment. but rather to preserve natural resources, that is why the goal in my home remains to continue a more responsible process in the rational use of electrical energy, carrying out small actions such as disconnecting plugs, not turning on the lights during the day, among others.

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression:  A positive linear relationship is found between the independent variable (x) that indicates the number of  Habitants in a home and the dependent variable (y) that indicates the increase in electrical energy, depending on the number of people in the home, the linear regression is ascending form because it estimates that if x rises and its value also increases, as mentioned previously in section number one, as the formula (y=86.80x+-176.00) has a positive slope (m=86.80), it makes the regression is not downward.</li>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors: Unlike the first diagram, in this one we find several values ​​in the intercept of x with y, we can denote that there are several different values ​​and therefore the linear regression line is not completely reliable. If we analyze the energy consumption in the In a house with 6 habitants, we can see that less energy is really spent than even some homes that have 4 members, so the relativity or the change in the KWH is due to the consumption that is made in each home and even the use that is It hits home appliances that use more energy.</li>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that: Making use of the equation y=86.80x -+ 176.00, we replace and assign to x the value of 200, because we want to know how much electricity a residence where 200 people live consumes, solving this gives us 17184.00kWh as a result.
  </li>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
